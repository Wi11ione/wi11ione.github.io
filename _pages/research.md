## Institute of Intelligent Vehicles, [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/), 2022.6-Present
* **Key Technologies for Self-Evolving Learning-Based Autonomous Driving Systems**, supported by the National Key R&D Program of China under Grant No2022YFB2502900, directed by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanjun-Huang-4)
  * Proposed a risk-guided policy optimization method for safety-critical scenario generation, which generates more diverse and plausible scenarios more efficiently.
  * Proposed an adversarial traffic participant behavior model combining traffic prior and reinforcement learning, which solves the limitation that adversarial scenario generation can only be applied to specific working conditions.
  * Proposed a safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static scenario parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of scenario generation.
  * Working on quantifying the diversity of scenarios and improving the diversity in safety-critical scenario generation for a comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicles.

* **Adaptive Evolution and Evaluation of Secure and Confident Intelligent Systems**, supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U23B2061, directed by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanjun-Huang-4)
  * Proposed an approach for the safety analysis of autonomous vehicles from complex safety-critical scenario data, which can intuitively reveal the distribution and characteristics of safety-critical scenarios for any given algorithm.
  * Proposed a safety boundary online identification method that learns from the test data under a long-tailed environment.

* **Self-Evolutionary Methods and Applications for Intelligent Systems in Complex Environments**, supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, Ministry of Education of China, directed by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanjun-Huang-4)
