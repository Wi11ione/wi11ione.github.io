**Introduction:** Safety-critical scenarios are essential for the safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles. To improve the efficiency of scenario generation, we propose an efficient safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static parameters that constitute a scenario by alternating the optimization of them. The proposed method enables more efficient, diverse, generalized, and plausible scenario generation with less time and arithmetic cost.

**Introduction:** Self-evolution refers to the ability of a system to evolve autonomously towards a better performance, which is a potential trend for autonomous driving systems based on self-learning approaches. This study analyzes some relevant technologies and then proposes a novel design mechanism to guarantee the self-evolving performance for autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we give some suggestions for its future directions for self-evolving autonomous driving, including some more cutting-edge technologies that can be incorporated into the DCL architecture.

**Introduction:** The real world is long-tailed distribution and thus has higher unknowns and complexity. Therefore the safety of decision-making algorithms cannot be fully guaranteed. We propose an online identification method of safety boundaries for arbitrary algorithms to improve their safety in long-tailed distribution. Experiment shows that the proposed method can greatly improve the safety of vehicle when facing unknown and complex scenarios with long-tailed distribution.

**Introduction:** We propose a safety-critical scenario generation method for autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given any traffic map and traffic rules, this method can quickly generate high-quality safety-critical scenarios by alternating the dynamic and static parameter optimization, quickly exposing the weakness of the given algorithm and facilitating the comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicles.

**Introduction:** We propose a software to generate safety-critical scenarios for the evaluation of autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given the map information, traffic rule information, and traffic density information of the test scenarios, the software can quickly generate reasonable, realistic, and diverse safety-critical scenarios for any autonomous driving algorithms, which is conducive to the comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance.
