**Introduction:** Safety-critical scenarios are essential for the safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles. To improve the efficiency of scenario generation, we propose an efficient safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static parameters that constitute a scenario by alternating the optimization of them. The proposed method enables more efficient, diverse, generalized, and plausible scenario generation with less time and arithmetic cost.

**Introduction:** We propose a safety-critical scenario generation method for autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given any traffic map and traffic rules, this method can quickly generate high-quality safety-critical scenarios by alternating the dynamic and static parameter optimization, quickly exposing the weakness of the given algorithm and facilitating the comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicles.

**Introduction:** We propose a software to generate safety-critical scenarios for the evaluation of autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given the map information, traffic rule information, and traffic density information of the test scenarios, the software can quickly generate reasonable, realistic, and diverse safety-critical scenarios for any autonomous driving algorithms, which is conducive to the comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance.
