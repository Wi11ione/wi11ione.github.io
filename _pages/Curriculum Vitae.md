Research Experience
======
* 2022.9-Present: Key Technologies for Self-Evolving Learning-Based Autonomous Driving Systems, Tongji University, Directed by Prof.Yanjun Huang
  * Supported by National Key R&D Program of China under Grant 2022YFB2502900
  * Proposed a risk-guided policy optimization method for safety-critical scenario generation, which generates more diverse and plausible scenarios more efficiently.
  * Proposed an adversarial traffic participant behavior model combining traffic prior and reinforcement learning, which solves the limitation that adversarial scenario generation can only be applied to specific working conditions.
  * Proposed a safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static scenario parameters, which greatly improves the efficiency of scenario generation.
  * Working on quantifying the diversity of scenarios and improving the diversity in safety-critical scenario generation for a comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicles.

  * Supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant U23B2061
  * Proposed an approach for the safety analysis of autonomous vehicles from complex safety-critical scenario data, which can intuitively reveal the distribution and characteristics of safety-critical scenarios for any given algorithm.
  * Proposed a safety boundary online identification method that learns from the test data under a long-tailed environment.

* 2023.2-Present: Self-Evolutionary Methods and Applications for Intelligent Systems in Complex Environments, Tongji University, Directed by Prof.Yanjun Huang
  * Supported by Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities， Ministry of Education of China
  * Working on applying continual reinforcement learning methods to improve the self-evolution of autonomous driving algorithms under safety-critical scenarios.
  * Working on combining naturalistic driving data with adversarial scenario generation to improve the naturalness and plausibility of the generated scenario.

* 2020.9-2021.6: Design of new generation chassis vehicle traveling system and its kinematic performance analysis, Jilin University, Directed by Prof.Hsin Guan
