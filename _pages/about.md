I'm a second-year master's student advised by Prof. Yanjun Huang at Tongji University, Shanghai, China. Prior to joining Tongji University, I received my Bachelor's degree from Jilin University, Changchun, China.

My research focuses on the safety of autonomous driving decision-making algorithms in long-tail environments. To achieve this goal, my work focuses on safety-critical scenario generation, safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles, and self-evolution of decision-making algorithms in safety-critical scenarios.

I am looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025 as well as potential collaborations, so feel free to contact me via my e-mail if you are interested in my research.
