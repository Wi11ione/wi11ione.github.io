I'm a second-year master's student advised by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanjun-Huang-4) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/), Shanghai, China. Before joining Tongji University, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/#), Changchun, China.

My research focuses on the safety of autonomous vehicles for decision-making in long-tail environments. To achieve this goal, my work includes safety-critical scenario generation, safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles, and self-evolution of decision-making algorithms in safety-critical scenarios.

I am looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025 as well as potential collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
