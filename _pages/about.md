I'm a second-year master's student advised by [Prof. Yanjun Huang](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yanjun-Huang-4) at [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/eng/), Shanghai, China. Before joining Tongji University, I received my Bachelor's degree from [Jilin University](https://www.jlu.edu.cn/#), Changchun, China.

My research focuses on the **safety of autonomous vehicles in long-tail environments**. Specifically, my work focuses on three main points: 
* **Safety-critical scenario generation**
    * Efficiency: How to efficiently generate safety-critical scenarios with lower time and arithmetic costs.
    * Quality: How to improve the generalizability, diversity, plausibility, and reality of safety-critical scenarios.
      
* **Safety evaluation of autonomous vehicle**
    * Safety analysis & evaluation of autonomous vehicles toward high-dimensional and complex scenario data.
    
* **Self-evolve mechanism for decision-making algorithms**
    * Mechanism for vehicles to continuously explore and learn safety-critical scenarios to achieve self-evolution.
    * Mixed-Reality Testing Platform for Autonomous Vehicles

I am looking for a PhD position for Fall 2025 as well as potential collaborations, so feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research.
