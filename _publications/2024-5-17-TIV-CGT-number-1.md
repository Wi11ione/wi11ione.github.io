excerpt: <img src='/images/paper1-framework.png'><br/> Safety-critical scenarios are essential for the safety evaluation of autonomous vehicles. To improve the efficiency of scenario generation, we propose an efficient safety-critical scenario generation method combining dynamic and static parameters that constitute a scenario by alternating the optimization of them. The proposed method enables more efficient, diverse, generalized, and plausible scenario generation with less time and arithmetic cost.
