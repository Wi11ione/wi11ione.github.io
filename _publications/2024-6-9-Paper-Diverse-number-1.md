excerpt: <img src='/images/paper1-framework.png'><br/> We propose a software to generate safety-critical scenarios for the evaluation of autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given the map information, traffic rule information, and traffic density information of the test scenarios, the software can quickly generate reasonable, realistic, and diverse safety-critical scenarios for any autonomous driving algorithms, which is conducive to the comprehensive evaluation of algorithm performance.
