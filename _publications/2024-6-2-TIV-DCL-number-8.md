title: "A Survey on Self-evolving Autonomous Driving: a Perspective on Data Closed-Loop Technology"
collection: publications
venue: 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Vehicles'
excerpt:  <img src='/images/paper2-framework.png'><br/> Self-evolution refers to the ability of a system to evolve autonomously towards a better performance, which is a potential trend for autonomous driving systems based on self-learning approaches. This study analyzes some relevant technologies and then proposes a novel design mechanism to guarantee the self-evolving performance for autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we give some suggestions for its future directions for self-evolving autonomous driving, including some more cutting-edge technologies that can be incorporated into the DCL architecture.
