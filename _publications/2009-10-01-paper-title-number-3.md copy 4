title: "Safety Boundary Online Identification for Autonomous Vehicle Considering Long-tailed Distribution"
collection: publications
date: under review
venue: 'IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation System'
excerpt: <img src='/images/paper3-framework.png'><br/>The real world is long-tailed distribution and thus has higher unknowns and complexity. Therefore the safety of decision-making algorithms cannot be fully guaranteed. We propose an online identification method of safety boundaries for arbitrary algorithms to improve their safety in long-tailed distribution. Experiment shows that the proposed method can greatly improve the safety of vehicle when facing unknown and complex scenarios with long-tailed distribution.
