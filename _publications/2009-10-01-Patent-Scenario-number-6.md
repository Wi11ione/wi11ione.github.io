title: "A Safety-Critical Scenario Generation Method for Autonomous Driving Decision-Making Algorithm"
collection: publications
venue: 'CN Patent'
excerpt: <img src='/images/paper1-framework.png'><br/> We propose a safety-critical scenario generation method for autonomous driving decision-making algorithms. Given any traffic map and traffic rules, this method can quickly generate high-quality safety-critical scenarios by alternating the dynamic and static parameter optimization, quickly exposing the weakness of the given algorithm and facilitating the comprehensive evaluation of autonomous vehicles.
