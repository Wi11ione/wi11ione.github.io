# Risk-Guided Adversarial Policy Optimization

**Date:** 2022.9-2023.9  
**Location:** Tongji University

## Overview
We proposed a risk-guided adversarial policy optimization method for safety-critical scenario generation, which generates more diverse and plausible scenarios more efficiently.

## Details
- **Objective:** To develop a method that improves the generation of diverse and plausible safety-critical scenarios.
- **Methodology:** Utilized risk-guided sampling and adversarial reinforcement learning techniques.
- **Results:** Achieved higher diversity and plausibility in scenario generation, contributing to more robust testing of autonomous driving systems.
- **Applications:** This method can be applied in various autonomous driving simulation environments to enhance safety and reliability.
